Whenever I smell strong tobacco smoke when I'm in an enclosed space such as a room, train, or aircraft, I begin to get angry. 
There are several reasons. 
First, medical researchers have shown that secondhand smoke, that is, the smoke from other people's cigarettes, causes cancer and other health problems. 
If the smoke were car exhaust or burning trash, we would put out the fire and open the windows to get rid of the smoke. Second, it stinks. The smoke drifts away from the smoker and fills the room. Even if I am not sitting close to the smoker, my hair and clothes pick up the smell. Third, I'm slightly allergic to smoke; therefore, my nose stuffs up when I smell tobacco smoke. Am I saying that all smoking should be banned? Of course not. Smokers have a right to smoke. However, the right of people to breathe pure air must always be put before the right of smokers to pollute that air.
There are three reasons why I prefer jogging to other sports. One reason is that jogging is a cheap sport. 



I can practise it anywhere at any time with no need for a ball or any other equipment. 

Another reason why I prefer jogging is that it is friendly to my heart.
 I don’t have to exhaust myself or do excessive efforts while jogging. Finally, I prefer this sport because it is safe. 
It isn’t as risky as other sports like gymnastics, racing or horseback riding. For all these reasons, I consider jogging the best sport of all.
