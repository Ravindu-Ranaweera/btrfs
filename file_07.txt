One way to start is by making a list of ideas you want to include in your paragraph.
Write a sentence that says what your paragraph is about. You may want to change your topic sentence after you finish writing your paragraph, if you find you've written about a different topic.
Link sentences by using pronouns referring to words in previous sentences.
Link sentences by repeating key words or words that are synonyms of key words from previous sentences.
Organize your paragraph by using words such as first, second, in conclusion, etc.
Link sentences by using transitional words such as, however, but, therefore, furthermore, then, to sum up, etc.
